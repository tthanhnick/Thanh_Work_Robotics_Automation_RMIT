# Thanh_Work_Robotics_Automation_RMIT
First of all, this work is related to robotics and automation, especially in robotics and PLC programming.
These files were mainly written in RAPID code (ABB robotic programming language).
Other languages are included such as Ladder diagram, G-code and Python.
This is my work as an engineering student at RMIT University Vietnam. Some of my works may contain codes from my studied courses and online sources.
This work contains my teammatesâ€™ contributions as well because some projects/assignments are group-related.
This place is an archive for my learning process at RMIT and I also used it to find a job. 
Although my work may not be original, you should cite and reference my code if you want to use it.
